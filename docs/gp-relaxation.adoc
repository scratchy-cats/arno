= GP Relaxation

the global pointer `gp`, points to a region in memory, where global variables
are stored. This is typically somewhere in bss. note that relaxation is
disabled for this instruction. Disabling gp relaxation, means that the linker
will not try to optimize the instruction,This is to avoid problems with
relative adressing.

[quote]
In -no-pie mode, GNU ld performs global pointer relaxation.
When producing an executable, linkers define __global_pointer$ at the start of
.sdata plus 0x800. The runtime initializes gp (x3) to the value of
__global_pointer$. When materializing an address +-2KiB of __global_pointer$,
we can replace lui+addi with one addi.
