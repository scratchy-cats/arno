= Physical Memory Protection (PMP) unit

____
PMP entries are described by an 8-bit configuration register and one
MXLEN-bit address register.

PMP entries are statically prioritized. The lowest-numbered PMP entry
that matches any byte of an access determines whether that access
succeeds or fails.

The PMP values are checked in parallel with PMA checks.

When paging is enabled, instructions that access virtual memory may
result in multiple physical-memory accesses, including implicit
references to the page tables. The PMP checks apply to all of these
accesses. The eâ†µective privilege mode for implicit page-table accesses
is S.
