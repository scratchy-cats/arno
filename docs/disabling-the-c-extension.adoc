According to the https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-gcc/issues/135[web],
this should not be enabled when using `rv64g` but we are currently using
`rv64gc`, due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80608[[rust release
build issues]. This should be further investigated.

`UNIMP` : C0001073. This is an alias for CSRRW x0, cycle, x0. Since cycle is a
read-only CSR, then (whether this CSR exists or not) an attempt to write into
it will generate an illegal instruction exception. This 32-bit form of UNIMP is
emitted when targeting a system without the C extension, or when the .option
norvc directive is used.
