= Code model

[quote]
The medium any code model, or medany, allows the code to address the range
between -2 GiB and +2 GiB from its position. By using auipc and load / store
instructions, when referring to an object, or addi, when calculating an address
literal, for example, a signed 32-bit offset, relative to the value of the pc
register, can be produced.
