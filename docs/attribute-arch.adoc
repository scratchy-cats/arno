The arch attribute specifies the target architecture for the function. The
value is a string that specifies the target architecture. It has influence on
the extensions that are enabled by default as well as the ABI.

When building rust code in release mode, and using global_asm to include
assembly, the  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80608[compiler does not
honor rusts target], so setting this attribute seems required to ensure the
correct architecture is used.
