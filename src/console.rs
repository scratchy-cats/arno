/*
  UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware protocol used for asynchronous
  serial communication between 2 devices.

  Read in detail : https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/products/test-and-measurement/essentials-test-equipment/digital-oscilloscopes/understanding-uart_254524.html.

  NOTE : In recent years, the popularity of UART has decreased: protocols like SPI and I2C have been
  replacing UART between chips and components. Instead of communicating over a serial port, most
  modern computers and peripherals now use technologies like Ethernet and USB.

// https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming/8250_UART_Programming#UART_Registers.
// These registers are memory mapped - assigned specific addresses within the system's memory address

// operations. The base register is mapped to the 0x1000_0000 memory address.
